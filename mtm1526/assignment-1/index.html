        You can put your script tag at the bottom.
        It's better for two reasons:
        1. If we want to manipulate HTML, the script tag runs after the
          HTML is rendered
        2. For usability, it makes our website feel faster because
          the browser doesnt pause to run the js until after evrything is rendered
